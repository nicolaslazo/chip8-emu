# chip8-emu

A Chip-8 emulator built in Python

I started this because of my interest in emulation since I was a kid. My plan is to eventually collaborate to state-of-the-art emulators if I have the time, but this is a start.

I'm also using this opportunity to get into the habit of writing code according to the industry code conventions, so commits are often run through pylint3 and pycodestyle before they are pushed.

Thanks to Cowgod for his technical reference. (http://devernay.fr2ee.fr/hacks/chip8/C8TECH10.HTM)
